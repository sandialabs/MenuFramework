# `MenuFramework`

## Introduction
The `MenuFramework` is a reusable Extended Reality (XR) multi-level menu system for the Unity Development Platform. The menu structure is architected for reusability to suit whatever need the developer may have for it. This project is a multi-level menu system that provides access to Extended Reality (XR) applications/projects.  The menu system is managed by a multi-level state machine.  This is designed to be the centralized documentation for the SNL XR Training Team collaboration effort encompassing the `MenuFramework` project.
